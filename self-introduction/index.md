Hello, my name is Vyacheslav Manzhela.
I'm currently working as a client consultant on motorcycles' spare parts.
Half a year ago I started frontend and Javascript courses in RS-School. 

I finished Belarusian State Economic University. After the University I worked for the investment agency in Minsk where I had a good chance to improve my English speaking level. After that I worked for Wargaming company as a Project manager in Global IT Department, where I got acquainted with IT sector and accompanied many projects in my department.

Before the University I have finished Gomel lyceum where I studied in Mathematical class. That's why programming seems so exciting for me. It was always fascinating for me to find out something new and dig deeper in the technology. A year ago I completed Java and Spring course at IT School Step. My current goal is to become full stack web developer.

In the RS-School there were many appealing projects, and I think the Pets project was the most practical one, because it's especially fascinating when you understand practical role of something that you make, think how to improve user experience from the usage of your website, and how to make a user to come back to you not only as a website visitor, but also as a future client. The main difficulty in the project was the usage of Javascript, but now looking back I understand that Javascript has a lot of possibilities inside. On the whole at the courses I have understood that it's three stages with all new technologies or features of programming language: at first you are frightened, then you can make a solution that corresponds to the documentation, but doesn't work or vice versa work, but you don't know why; and the third stage is when everything works good and you possibly want to make it even better.

Currently I'm studying Webpack in Javascript and it seems for me a lot like Spring for Java programming language. New stack of technologies that widen your possibilities and level up your code. It's like to compare a bicycle with a car. So I've got a list of books to read, a bunch of technologies to study. So let's make amazing websites!
